# PlayGround

Cleanup summary (AI + Voxelcraft only)
- Kept: AI API-calling code in src/agentHelp (OpenAI/XAI client and prompts)
- Kept: voxelcraft demo (voxelcraft/*) and run_voxelcraft.py
- Moved to trash/: everything else (backend modules, experiments, tools, tests, misc scripts)

If you need anything restored, move it back out of trash/.

# Voxelcraft (minimal Minecraft-like clone)

A minimal WebGL voxel world with long-horizon fog, chunk streaming, and per-block color jitter. No dependencies; open the HTML file to play.

Features
- Infinite-ish terrain via streamed chunks around the player
- Simple value-noise terrain with water, grass, dirt, sand, and stone
- Per-block base colors with slight deterministic randomization
- Horizon fog with adjustable distance (+/-)
- Mouse look and WASD flight movement (space up, shift down/boost)
- Block editing: left-click to remove, right-click to place; select block type with 1-8 (Grass, Dirt, Stone, Sand, Water, Wood, Leaves, Snow)
- Persistent edits saved to localStorage (auto-load next time you open); namespaced per world seed
- Directional lighting with a smooth day/night cycle
- Target block outline to improve building precision
- Semi-transparent water rendered in a separate pass
- Sky color follows the time of day
- Time controls: [ and ] speed, T pause, ; noon, ' midnight
- Crosshair and hotbar UI, wheel to cycle block, middle-click to pick
- Optional walk mode with gravity (press G to toggle; Space jump, Shift sprint)
- Undo/Redo for block edits via toolbar buttons or shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+Z to undo, Ctrl+Y or Shift+Cmd+Z to redo)
- Minimap (H toggle) with local height/biome preview in the top-right
- Deterministic world seeds: Seed button or overlay inputs to set/randomize; terrain/trees/jitter seeded
- Deterministic world seeds: click Seed button to set/randomize; terrain, trees, and color jitter are seeded and edits are stored per-seed
- Adjustable view distance (, and .) and field of view (/ and ?) at runtime

How to run
- Easiest: python3 run_voxelcraft.py (starts a local server and opens your browser)
- Or open voxelcraft/index.html directly in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
- Or serve manually:
  - cd voxelcraft && python3 -m http.server 8000
  - Open http://localhost:8000/

Once loaded
- Click "Click to Lock Pointer" to capture the mouse.
- Controls: WASD move, Space up (fly)/jump (walk), Shift down/boost (fly)/sprint (walk), +/- adjust fog.
- Build: Left click remove, Right click place, 1–8 block select (Grass/Dirt/Stone/Sand/Water/Wood/Leaves/Snow), middle-click pick, mouse wheel cycle.
- Time: [ and ] speed, T pause, ; noon, ' midnight.
- UI: Hotbar at bottom, Export/Import/Clear buttons for edits, Screenshot button, Undo/Redo, Seed, Minimap (H).

Notes
- This is a tiny demo focused on performance and simplicity rather than full gameplay.
- View distance can be tuned in voxelcraft/main.js by changing viewDistance.chunks and fogDistance.
- Water is not placeable via hotkeys and remains generated by terrain/waterline logic.

This repository contains a simple dual chatbot example. You can choose which
model each agent uses. The default is OpenAI, but you can switch either side to
an XAI model based on `distilgpt2`.

Example usage:

```bash
python dual_chatbot/bot_conversation.py --seller-model openai --buyer-model xai
```

Each agent has private functions that are not shared with the other. The seller
has access to a `seller_secret` tool and the buyer can call `buyer_secret`.

## Evolving Cellular Automata (Terminal Demo)

- Folder: evo_automata/
- Run a terminal demo of Life-like CA and optionally evolve the rule for interesting behavior.

Quick start
- python3 -m evo_automata --rule B3/S23 --width 64 --height 32 --steps 200 --fps 15
- python3 -m evo_automata --evolve --width 64 --height 32 --steps 200 --fps 15

## LeadGen Scoring API (toward a billion‑dollar GTM)

- New endpoint: POST /leadgen/score
- Purpose: Score inbound messages and recommend next actions/replies for real‑estate lead qualification and conversion.

Example request
```
POST /leadgen/score
{
  "message": "Hi, I’m pre-approved and ready to buy ASAP. Budget around $750k. Can we see 123 Oak St this week?",
  "name": "Alex Buyer",
  "phone": "+1 (650) 555-1234",
  "email": "alex@example.com",
  "channel": "sms"
}
```

Example response
```
{
  "score": 89,
  "stage": "hot",
  "recommendedAction": "Call within 5 minutes and propose 2-3 tour times for the next 48 hours.",
  "recommendedReply": "Hi Alex, thanks for reaching out! I can help you line up tours this week. Do any of these times work for a quick 10‑minute call to confirm details: today 5:30pm, tomorrow 10:30am, or tomorrow 1:00pm?",
  "extracted": { "budget": 750000, "timeline": "week", "explicitSignals": ["signal:asap", "signal:pre-approved", "budget_mentioned"] }
}
```

Notes
- This is a heuristic baseline meant to integrate with conversation flows, schedulers, and CRMs.
- Next steps: add model‑driven scoring, A/B tests, funnels, and automated outreach cadences.

## Mega Art

Combine all ASCII and SVG artworks into a single consolidated view.

- Generate: `python3 tools/make_mega_art.py`
- Outputs:
  - `art/mega/mega_ascii.txt` (all ASCII pieces with headers)
  - `art/mega/mega.svg` (grid of all SVGs with labels)
  - `art/mega/index.html` (viewer for both)
- Open `art/mega/index.html` in your browser.

## Live ASCII Camera Studio

Real-time webcam-to-ASCII renderer with style presets, motion trails, and optional recording.

- Open `art/ascii_cam/index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox/Safari)
- Click Start Camera, tweak columns, trails, invert, and choose presets
- Click Record to capture a short WebM clip of the ASCII output

## Test Flakiness Hunter (Experimental)

Run a test command multiple times under small perturbations (seed, TZ, jitter),
cluster intermittent failures, and generate a report.

Quick start

```bash
python3 tools/flakiness_hunter/cli.py --cmd "pytest -q" --runs 20
```

Outputs
- .flakiness_hunter/<timestamp>/report.md — human-readable summary
- .flakiness_hunter/<timestamp>/report.json — structured data
- .flakiness_hunter/<timestamp>/run_XXX.json — per-run logs

## Sonified Debugger for Logs (Experimental)

Turn log lines into simple tones to help notice anomalies in real time.

Quick start

```bash
# From stdin
python3 tools/sonify_logs/cli.py --dur 80 << 'LOGS'
INFO service starting
WARN disk space low
ERROR failed to connect
LOGS

# Follow a file
python3 tools/sonify_logs/cli.py /var/log/app.log --follow --quiet
```

Notes
- On macOS, audio plays via `afplay`; on Linux, via `aplay/paplay`; on Windows, `winsound`; otherwise, falls back to a terminal bell.
- Use --quiet to suppress echoing the input if piping into another tool.

## Live ASCII Camera Studio

Webcam to ASCII in your browser with presets, trails, and recording.

- Open art/ascii_camera/index.html in a modern browser. Use localhost/https for camera access.
- Controls:
  - Charset presets: classic/dense/sparse/blocks
  - Columns, font size, contrast, trail alpha
  - Options: colorize, invert, mirror
- Snapshot (PNG) and Record (WebM) buttons

## Procedural Curriculum Maker

Interactive lessons to teach algorithms and generative art.

- Open art/curriculum/index.html in your browser.
- Lessons included:
  - Sorting Visualizer: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Quick — step-by-step, speed control, pause/step.
  - L-System Fractals: Koch/Tree/Dragon presets, tweak rules and iterations, save PNG.

## Rule Explorer — Edge of Chaos

Explore Life-like CA rules on an entropy–activity map, preview, bookmark, and export.

- Open art/rule_explorer/index.html in your browser.

- Click points to preview rules; bookmark interesting rules; export/import bookmarks as JSON.

## Ideation: Generate Creative Project Ideas

A tiny ideation utility to spark what to build next.

- Generate n ideas deterministically with a seed:

      python3 -m ideation --num 5 --seed 42

It uses a few simple strategies (mashups, SCAMPER, persona “How Might We”) and prints titles, summaries, and tags.
